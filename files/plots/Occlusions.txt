Tried 20 different percentages between 0% and 100%
minimum length of a digit is 4
cubic spline interpolation
applied all preprocessing except for clean digit points after occlusions.
applied clean points preprocessing before occlusions because we want 
at least 4 unique points in the sequence
(since spline interpolation deletes repeated points before interpolation,
so we need at least 4 points left to be able to calculate the spline)
